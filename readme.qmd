This project is for my final project for PM 566: Introduction to Data Science. It looks at the relationship of age, mechanism of injury, and home/injury neighborhood with incidence of pediatric trauma in Los Angeles County.

You can see the final product at my website: <https://er12457.github.io/PM566-Final/>

Thanks for stopping by!
